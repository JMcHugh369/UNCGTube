Our app will be similar to YouTube but exclusively for UNCG students. Our mission is to help students grow in the social media realm. It is hard for influencers to grow on popular social media sites. UNCGTube will act as a starter to help grow the influencer's follower base. Ideally, this fanbase will support their chosen influencer on bigger platforms. This app is great for UNCG students because most influencers are going to be seen as relatable.
